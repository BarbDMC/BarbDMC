      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        I&apos;m a Full Stack developer that wants to use technology to build useful
        solutions that will enhance people&apos;s lives by maximizing the effect that
        technology can provide.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m a communicative, persistent, and self-taught person.
        who always stays up-to-date with industry trends in order 
        to provide better solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this, I&apos;ve been learning technologies like JavaScript, AngularJS, 
        NodeJS, and MongoDB in order to collaborate in the education sector.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I want to keep developing myself since I want to contribute to fields
        like volunteering, E-learning, and accessibility.
